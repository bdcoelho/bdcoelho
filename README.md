# My portfolio page
### The page can be accessed at https://bdcoelho.github.io/

* This is a webpage highlighting my work experience and professional achievements.
* I've used the bootstrap framework to make the page responsive. I have tested the page on laptop, large monitor, and mobile device for responsiveness
* The site includes a contact page. While contact details are provided, the form submission does not currently work as the page is hosted on github and github does not support php
* The main page index.html contains highlights of the type of work that I am specialized in.
* The portfolio page contains my professional history and achievements
